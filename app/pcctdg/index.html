                <div id="thetext">A paragraph is a group of words put together to form a group that is  usually longer than a sentence. Paragraphs are often made up of many sentences. They are     usually between four to eight sentences. Paragraphs can begin with an indentation (about five   spaces), or by missing a line out, and then starting again; this makes telling when one   paragraph ends and another begins easier.
