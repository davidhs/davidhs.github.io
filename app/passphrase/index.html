Targets:
<ul>
	<li>1 bit of entropy: you'd at most have to guess twice, not very secure.</li>
	<li>39.86 bits of entropy: NSA would be able to guess at least in one second (1 trillion guesses per second).  They probably have more computational power.</li>
	<li>72.094 bits of entropy: cracked on average in 80 years at 1 trillion guesses per second </li>
	<li>278.4 bits of entropy: cracked on average in 80 years at 1 trillion guesses per second and guessing rate continuosly doubling every year for 80 years.</li>
	<li>301.1 bits of entropy: uncrackable by any classical computer for 100 years.</li>
	<li>602.2 bits of entropy: uncrackable by any classical or quantum computer for 100 years.</li>
	<li>626.65 bits of entropy: uncrackable by any classical computer until Dark age of universe.</li>
	<li>1253 bits of entropy: uncrackable by any classical or quantum quantum until Dark age of universe.</li>

Notes:
<ul>
	<li>Don't reuse your password / passphrase</li>
	<li>The quality of the passwords / passphrases on this site hinges on the quality of my code (*gulp*) and the quality of the random number generator source of <code>window.crypto.getRandomValues</code></li>
	<li>Don't make up your own passwords / passphrases if you don't have to.  It's really tough to measure the strength of such a password / passphrase.</li>
	<li>Don't trust this site.</li>
	<li>Each bit of entropy doubles the strength of the password on a classical computer and two bits doubles the strength on a quantum computer.</li>
	<li>How strong does your password / passphrase need to be?  It depends on your potential adversary
		<ul>
			<li>Let's say your adversary is capable of 1 trillion guesses per second, that is 10<sup>12</sup> guesses per second, and you want your password to go uncracked for 80 years assuming guessing rate doesn't change, how strong does your password need to be? Let E be the bits of entropy that are required to withstand G guesses (on average), then E = 1 + log<sub>2</sub>(G), and guessing at that rate for 80 years would total about 2.52 * 10<sup>21</sup> guesses, E would be 72.094 bits of entropy</li>
			
			<li>Let's say the guessing rate G<sub>r</sub> is G<sub>r</sub>(t) = 2<sup>&alpha; * (t - &beta;)</sup> * &gamma;, where &alpha; is the doubling rate, t is the time, &beta; is the time-offset, and &gamma; is the guessing rate at time t = &beta;. If time is measured in years and the doubling rate is &alpha; = 2, i.e. guessing rate doubles every year (continuously), and the guessing rate in 2018 of our adversary is 10<sup>18</sup> guesses per second, i.e. G<sub>r</sub>(2018) = 10<sup>18</sup> guesses per second, how many guesses can we expect to take place in 80 years?  The answer is &int;<sub>a</sub><sup>b</sup> G<sub>r</sub>(t) dt, where a is 2018 and b = 2018 + 80 = 2098.  G(t) = &int; G<sub>r</sub>(t) dt = G<sub>r</sub>(t) / (&alpha; * log(2)).  The number of guesses, G, would be G = G(2098) - G(2018) = 1.054 * 10<sup>60</sup> guesses, which is significantly more than in the example above.  E = 1 + log<sub>2</sub>(G) = 139.2 bits of entropy, and twice that on a quantum computer (i.e. 278.4 bits)</li>
			
			<li>What might the fundamental limit be?  In the visible universe there between 10<sup>78</sup> to 10<sup>82</sup> atoms, so to be conservative let's say 10<sup>82</sup> atoms.  Let's say each atom is capable of making a guess in one Planck time, i.e. t<sub>p</sub> = 5.39 * 10<sup>-44</sup>s, or f<sub>p</sub> = 1.86 * 10<sup>43</sup> guesses per second.  We want our passphrase to be secure until the universe enters the Dark era, roughly T = 10<sup>100</sup> years.  How many bits of entropy does our passphrase need to have?  The number of guesses would be G = T * C<sub>ys</sub> * f<sub>p</sub>, where C<sub>ys</sub> = 3.16 * 10<sup>6</sup> or how many seconds in a year, and we'd need E = 1 + log<sub>2</sub>(G) = 636.65 bits of entropy.  A 100 charachter alphanumeric password with special symbols would suffice.  Double that to resist quantum computer, i.e. 1253.3 bits of entropy.  You will never need a password with more than 1253 bits of entropy forever.</li>
