

1 inch = 2.54 cm


15 turns per 38 - 39 cm

Mouse DPI was either 200, 400 or 600 (I suspect 600).
It was 600


2.5333 - 2.6 cm per turn OR
0.99737 - 1.0236 inches per turn


I suspect that with


MouseSensitivity=50

MouseSensitivityMultiplierUnit=0.020000
XFactorAiming=0.020000
AimDownSightsMouse=100

that when you move your mouse one inch you complete a rotation.

Yes

Settings


MouseYawSensitivity=25
MousePitchSensitivity=25

means you need to move your mouse 4 inches to complete a rotation.


I suspect MouseSensitivity and MouseSensitivityMultiplierUnit are multiplied 
together to get a general sensitivity

Actually I suspect it move at 1 / 2pi of an angle
