# Mind's eye exercise: Meditation with eyes open to notice random mind's eye images appearing

I think I may have accidentally discovered a mind's eye exercise.

I was preparing myself to do mind's eye exercise. It usually involves sitting down and meditating for 10 minutes to calm the mind.

For a long time I have had the issue that I easily succumb to dullness/torpor when I sit down to meditate with eyes close, so I decided to have them open.
Now, I have a bit of esophoria, so I prefer to sit against a wall no farther than 1 meter so my eyes can converge on a single point on it.

When my eyes are open fixated on a point long enough that they stop moving my vision starts to gray out (see [Troxler's fading on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troxler%27s_fading)).

So I sat there, with stable eyes, calming my entire being.

I noticed that random vague mental images would pop up every now and again. So I reoriented myself and set the intention to notice any mental imagery when it would randomly pop up.

Every once in a while a random mental image would pop up. Then I'd set the intention to see the food I prepared this moment. Nothing happened for a while and then and image popped up.

The images that popped up were very vague since I have hypophantasia, but the longer I did it, the more I could persist the images and explore the mind's eye scene.
