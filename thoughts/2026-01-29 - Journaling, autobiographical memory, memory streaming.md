# Journaling to strengthen one's autobiographical memory, and memory streaming

Once upon a time I was very interested in lucid dreaming.

I think it was some time after I began seriously practicing meditation (by following the book _The Mind Illuminated_ by Culadasa) and having talked about it with friends.

Usually I don't remember my dreams, and when I remember them they are usually vague, colorless, dark and lacking in detail.

At some point I discovered [r/LucidDreaming](https://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/) and in the wiki section of that subreddit there is useful information about how to achieve lucid dreaming. The thing I did was practiced doing _reality checks_ (e.g. turn on/off lights (not reliable in dreams), read text (constantly changing in sleep), looking into a mirror (likey don't see your own face), etc.), holding a dream diary (instantly when I wake up, if I remember anything, either write it down or record it as quickly as possible before I forget it) and reading some entries before sleep, and finally WILD (Wake-Induced Lucid Dreaming).

Holding a dream diary helped a lot. The more I wrote, and the more detailed my descriptions where (including auditory, visual, tactile descriptions), the easier it was for me to remember dreams, and I'd remember more each time I dreamt and in more detail. So it is as if one writes down one's dreams it strengthens some pathways in the brain that makes dream recall easier, higher resolution, and such.

Even after holding a dream diary for weeks my dreams were still almost always murky, almost always lacking color, feeling dark or lacking illumination.

I would very rarely achieve lucid dreaming from just a regular dream, and when it happened I would always immediately wake up.

What helped me to achieve "reliable" lucid dreaming (perhaps 1x per week) was WILD (or WILD + WBTB (Wake Back To Bed)) (you can read about it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/trz9z/beginners_wild_method_adjustments_tricks_and_tips/)).

I think the idea is that most of our REM dreams in the latter half of one's sleep, after about 5 hours of sleep. So, what you do is you wake yourself after about 5 hours of sleep, keep yourself awake for 10 - 60 minutes (10 - 15 minutes seemd to work OK for me). When you went back to bed what you'd do is to find a comfortable position that you can lie absolutely still in, and then what you do is you try to completely relaxed but maintain your awareness on something (e.g. your heartbeat, breath, or whatever). It is very important to stay completely still.

At some point you start to experience hypnagogia (basically you are between being asleep and awake and you experience hallucinagenic imagery/sounds/scenarios), and if you remain calm, still, but with your awareness still kind of intact you may all of a sudden hear continuous loud sound and pulling sensations on your body (like being abducted by aliens) (which to me kind of feels like what I'd imagine "portaling between worlds" may feel like), and then it calms down, you find yourself where you fell asleep, not sure whether or not you are asleep or not.

Now, at that time I used to sleep with a sleep mask. I had put on the sleep mask before falling asleep. When I was lying in bed I could see the cabinets from where I was lying (as if I could see through the sleep mask).

At this point you've entered into an in-between state. I think this is basically just a sleep paralysis state. You can exit the state by waking up, or you can exit the state by transitioning it to a lucid dreaming state.

In the sleep paralysis state you are in a dream state, but you can't move (hence paralyzed). You very likely hear voices, you may experience a dark presence in the space you fell asleep in. It really helps to know and realize that one is in a sleep paralysis sleep state.

If it becomes to frightening you can just try to jolt yourself to wake yourself up.

To transition to a lucid dreaming state you can imagine something outside of the room or building, and then just decide/imagine to fly up with your body or there.

Once you have entered into the lucid dreaming state then it transitions to a regular dream state, except where you maintain awareness and different levels of control (all the way from no control to absolute control).

For those who haven't experienced lucid dreaming, I highly recommend trying it.

Anyways, this reminded me of when I was doing the phantasia exercise _memory streaming_ (see [Alec Figueroa's Visualization Mega Guide section on Memory Streaming](https://www.alecfigueroa.com/post/visualization-training-mega-guide#:~:text=gaps%2E-,Memory,fuzzy)), which, I think, helped my increase my visualization ability.

What if I held a diary, where I not only wrote the events or thoughts of the day, but also visual, auditory, tactile, gustatory, etc. sensations/descriptions? And if I tried to remember something vague? And I regularly read the entries?

Would that help with autobiographical memory, or access to it, like how it appeard to do with remembering my dreams?

It is a hypothesis I am willing to try out.

NOTE: I did a slight variation of _memory streaming_, where I would first meditate for 10 - 20 minutes (calming and collecting the mind), and I'd go outside, find a calm spot, and walk backwards and forwards some route, as if I was doing walking meditation, and fixate on a certain memory. Sometimes, after about 10 - 30 minutes of memory streaming that way there would be a noticable jump in my visualization ability (like it went from lowish middleish hypophantasia to low common phantasia) and I'd have substantially more access to memories. Once I stopped, it would go away after about 5 - 10 minutes (kind of like how a muscle pump is short-lived).
